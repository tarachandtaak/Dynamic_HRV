# D-HRV 1.0: Dynamic Heart Rate Variablity Toolbox
Performs dynamic analysis of the heart rate variablity and it's derived measures. 

Implemented Computational Order for Dynamic-HRV analysis: 


         1). Peak Detection 
                           Saves computational time, if peak exists! 


Peak Detection. Once the raw data has been processed the peaks (bands in gel images) need to be identified. Peaks are detected as local maxima. A correct peak detection is tricky because the peaks within a sample can overlap. The trace curve is the sum of all peak signals.

         2). Peak Correction 

                           False peak removal
                           Adds missing peak

 
         3). Outlier detection and removal of peak difference (IBI) 
                           Ecotic peak correction


         4). IBI input -> HRV and sliding window HRV measures analysis 
                           Time and frequency measures
